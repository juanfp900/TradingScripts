INSTALLATION ----Instructions are for a MAC OSX/linux Python3 environment------------------
It is highly recommended to run these scripts within a virtual environment in your machine
and not within your system. It is best not to disrupt current packages, libraries that some
programs may be using currently within your machine. 

Note: If you are using Python2 or Windows, the following instructions may not be accurate. 
Refer to for support:
	 https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/

1. Installing Virtual Environment 
	python3 -m pip install --user venv 		# Install virtual environment 
	mkdir "folder_name" 					# Create folder in desired location 
	python3 -m venv "folder_name"			# Create virtual environment
	source ./"folder_name"/bin/activate		# Activate virtual environment 

2. Install Following packages within your Virtual Environment 
	pip install pandas						# Manipulate data coming from API
	pip install alpha_vantage				# API to return real time stock data
	pip install matplotlib					# Library to plot data
	pip install openpyxl					# R/W excel files from python
	pip install twilio>=6.0.0				# instalL twilio packages for receiving text notification
	
	
3. Get API stock data from AlphaVantage (All scripts will need this)
		All scripts within this branch will need to get a API_key from 
   		https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key 
	 	which allows you to read and manipulate real time stock data through python. 
		Sign up and you will receive your own API Key

 
4. Receive notification messages instantly on your phone (Used only if running alert-stockPrice-SMALine.py)
 		You will need to sign up for a Twilio account if you are running "alert-stockPrice-SMALine.py" 
 		https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio
		You should receive a Twilio Account SID, Auth Token and a Twilio number
		Copy these values in the appropriate lines
